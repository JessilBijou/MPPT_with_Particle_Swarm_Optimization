# MPPT_with_Particle_Swarm_Optimization
Solar Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using a PIC microcontroller, MPLAB, and PSC

Hardware Setup:

You'll need a PIC microcontroller, a solar panel, and the necessary circuitry to interface the microcontroller with the solar panel.
Software Components:

MPLAB X IDE for PIC microcontroller development.
PSC (Particle Swarm Optimization) framework for PSO implementation.
Python for data analysis and visualization.
Code Overview:

PIC Microcontroller Code (MPLAB):

Configure the PIC microcontroller's ADC for reading the solar panel voltage and current.
Implement the PSO algorithm to track the maximum power point (MPP) using MPLAB XC8 or XC16.
Use PWM to control the duty cycle of a buck or boost converter to match the MPP voltage.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Code (PSC):

Develop PSO algorithm code using the PSC framework provided by your microcontroller manufacturer.
Implement the PSO algorithm to search for the MPP based on the voltage and current measurements.

Python Code:

Use Python for data analysis and visualization of solar panel performance.
You can use libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data processing and plotting.
